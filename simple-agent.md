# Evaluations on the Effectiveness of LM Agents with BugSwarm 

We will test the efficacy of CIFailureFix-Agent using `tananaev-traccar-64783123` as an example artifact. It is a Java artifact and from github, we come to know its diff size is 2.

# Setting up the CIFailureFix-Agent

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone -b debug https://github.com/BugSwarm/CIFailureFix-Agent.git
```

2. Go inside `CIFailureFix-Agent/swe-agent`
```bash
cd CIFailureFix-Agent/swe-agent
```

3. Run
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --editable .
```
at the repository root (as with any python setup, it's recommended to use conda or virtual environments to manage dependencies).

3. Create a `keys.cfg` file. Contents will be like
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=""
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
BUGSWARM_TOKEN=""
```

4. Go into `swe-agent` folder and run 
```bash
./setup.sh
```

# Running python script for generating the patch

1. Go into swe-agent folder
```bash
cd CIFailureFix-Agent/swe-agent
```

2. For generating patch
```bash
python3 run.py --model_name <llm_model_name> --data_path <bugswarm_image_name> --config_file config/default_from_url.yaml  --per_instance_cost_limit 2.0
```
For bugswarm image we are using `tananaev-traccar-64783123`

<llm_model_name> refers the mapped name of the llms. Here is the list of Open-ai models which we can use

| Short Name | Model |
| --- | --- |
| gpt3 | gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 |
| gpt3-legacy | gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613|
| gpt4 | gpt-4-1106-preview |
| gpt4-legacy | gpt-4-0613|
| gpt4-0125 | gpt-4-0125-preview|
| gpt4-turbo | gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09 |
| gpt4o | gpt-4o-2024-05-13|
| gpt-4o-mini | gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 |
| gpt4-legacy | gpt-4-0613|
| gpt4-0125 | gpt-4-0125-preview|

if we want to use `gpt-4-1106-preview` we will replace `<llm_model_name>` with `gpt4`
command will be
```bash
python3 run.py --model_name gpt4 --data_path tananaev-traccar-64783123 --config_file config/default_from_url.yaml  --per_instance_cost_limit 2.0
```

After running the command, the agent will use its command by communicating with LLM to generate the patch. As we are producing patches for
bugswarm, the pipeline evaluates the patch by building the repo inside bugswarm container. For the artifact, `tananaev-traccar-64783123`, we get the build output

# Testing the patch generated by CIFailureFix-Agent(optional):

We will test the generated patch with our hands. Let's follow the steps:

1. Go into `CIFailureFix-Agent` folder

```bash
cd <path_to_CIFailureFix-Agent>
```

For our example the path is `/home/ubuntu/CIFailureFix-Agent`

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/CIFailureFix-Agent
```

2. We have to find out the container id using this

```bash
docker ps -a
```

After executing this, we will get a list of the containers running. We have to find the id using bugswarm image name

3. Copy the `repo_reset.sh` file into that container

```bash
docker cp repo_reset.sh <container_id>:/home/travis/
```

4. After getting the container id, we will enter into the container

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

5. Change mode for the script `repo_reset.sh` and execute it.
```bash
chmod +x repo_reset.sh
./repo_reset.sh <build_system> <folder1> <folder2>
```
for the tutorial, we are using `travis` build system, folder1 will be `tananaev`, folder2 will be `traccar`. So the command will be

```bash
./repo_reset.sh travis tananaev traccar
```


6. Enter into the path `/home/travis/build/failed/tananaev/traccar`

```bash
cd /home/travis/build/failed/tananaev/traccar
```

7. Apply the patch on the folder

```bash
cp ~/model.patch /home/travis/build/failed/tananaev/traccar/
git apply model.patch
```

8. Run the script to build the repo to see if the build process is successful 

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin
./run_failed.sh
```
